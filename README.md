# Image-generation-using-genetic-algorithm
Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. In this project image is generated by implementing genetic algorithm is Python.

Add the files in Pycharm Python and run the programme.
